I did everything I could... blocking and hitting. But  nothing worked. It felt like none of our practices during the year has helped. We've got to learn how to deal with those sneaky spikes better! I even remember so well that after the game, our coach blamed us for playing badly. Nobody could speak up. We all stayed silent.
